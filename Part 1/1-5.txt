// Run the curl command, did not work because it isn't installed yet

1st command attempted {
    docker run --name ubu ubuntu sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://helsinki.fi;'
}

// Tried installing curl by itself before running the curl command

2nd command attempted {
    docker run --name ubu ubuntu sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; apt-get -y install curl; curl http://helsinki.fi;'
}

//Needed to run apt-get update before installing curl, so all the packages would have their latest updates

3rd and final command attempted that worked {
    docker run --name ubu ubuntu sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; apt-get update; apt-get -y install curl; curl http://helsinki.fi;'
}
